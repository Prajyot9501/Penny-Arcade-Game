# Penny-Arcade-Game

The project "Penny Arcade: Laser Quest" is a comprehensive exploration into the integration of physical computing and interactive gameplay through the innovative use of laser technology and optical principles. It is designed as an engaging two-player game where participants use mirrors to direct laser beams towards a target, which moves based on the feedback from an ultrasonic sensor. The project incorporates a variety of technologies including Arduino microcontrollers for processing inputs and controlling the game mechanics, servo motors coupled with rack and pinion setups to adjust the laser's direction, and photoresistors to detect the laser's position. This setup is designed not just for entertainment but also as an educational tool, demonstrating the principles of light reflection, precision control, and real-time feedback systems.

## Components Used: 
- Arduino Mega: This is the main logic control unit of the project. This controller has the logic to start, carry out the logic and end the game. Each component mentioned below is connected to this controller.
- Photoresistors (GM5539 resistor)
- Resistor
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- LCD Screen 
- LED light
- Buzzer
- Servo motor (SG90)
- Laser module
- Arduino Uno: This Arduino Uno module is used to control the mirrors in the game. This is a smaller Arduino as it doesn’t have a lot of inputs and outputs to process.
- Servo motor (MG996R)
- Joystick Module
